      "I decided to create this website to automate the process of creating streaming playlists. Streaming playlists are playlists created by fans of artists to increase the streams of a song on Spotify. The playlist has multiple instances of the song chosen by the user with two to three songs wedged between each instance. The non-streaming songs are derived from the userâ€™s liked songs, most listened to songs, and other songs released by the artist of the chosen song.",
