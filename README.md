# Personal Website
I wanted to create a website for myself where I can showcase my projects and show some of my personality through the site design. This was the first time that I created a moodpboard and mockups before beginning the coding process. I found that having thought of the design beforehand made the development process much easier as I was able to focus only on the code since the design was already finished.

## Demo

## Technologies
This project was created using:
- React
- Styled Components
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- The home has a simple greeting and welcomes the user to the site. 
- The work page shows my past work experience. 
- The projects page has a list of my personal projects and each list item links to their own page. 
- The contact page has my contact info.

## Installation
You will need to have Node >= version 15.11 and npm >= version 7.14.
- Download files to a folder of your choosing.
- Navigate to the folder in terminal using `cd`.
- Install the dependencies and run the code by typing the following in a new terminal:
```
npm install
npm install react-icons --save
npm install --save styled-components
npm start
```
